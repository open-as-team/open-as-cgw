How to deploy the Open AS Communication Gateway
===============================================

1. Installation
Deployment is quite easy. First, make sure that you successfully installed your
Open AS Communication Gateway according to the installation instructions found
at doc/INSTALL.

2. Connectivity
Next, make sure your Open AS Communication gateway is reachable from the
Internet (if you intend to use it for real-world mail traffic). This means,
you either have to assign a public IP to your installation, or at least forward
port 25 from a publicly reachable address.

3. DNS MX records
You will have to point the DNS MX records to the Open AS Communication Gateway,
either directly (AS has a public IP) or to the host you're forwarding port 25
from, for all domains you want the Open AS to accept mails for.

4. Web-GUI configuration
Add all of your SMTP servers the Open AS Communication Gateway shall relay
incoming mail to, to the list of SMTP servers within the Open AS web-frontend:
Log in and go to "Mail Transfer -> SMTP Servers".

Finally, add all of the domains you want the Open AS Communication Gateway to
accept mails for. Go to "Mail Transfer -> Domains".

These settings are the only requirements for the Open AS in order to get mail
scanned and relayed for you. However, I'd highly recommend to have a closer
look at the numerous other pages the web-frontend offers, to optimize the
scanning procedures.
