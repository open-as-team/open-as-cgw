How to test the Open AS Communication Gateway
=============================================

Since the Open AS Communication Gateway aims to be a component which gets
integrated in an existing mailing infrastructure, testing requires some
effort.

At least, you need to have a working SMTP server. For testing purposes, you may
want to set up a simple Postfix installation on a virtual machine, you can
relay mail traffic to.

For generating test e-mails, I'd recommend the really cool command-line tool
"swaks" (Swiss Army Knife SMTP - http://www.jetmore.org/john/code/swaks/):
  $ swaks -f someuser@somedomain.tld -t user@yourdomain.tld -s <open-as-IP>

Swaks also supports SMTP authentication (SASL), attachments and a large number
or other cool features.

Unfortunately, there is no automated testing environment available until now,
any enhancements in this direction would be highly appreciated.
