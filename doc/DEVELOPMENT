GENERAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES
===============================================================================

The OpenAS is an SMTP gateway. This means, it accepts mail for certain domains
(as far as it's not considered spam), does content scanning and relays it to
predefined SMTP servers.
The OpenAS is NOT a fully-fledged MTA-suite:
 * it does not define mail-boxes or user-accounts,
 * it does not handle any kind of mail retrieval (POP, IMAP, ...)


External software-components used:
 * postfix as central MTA
 * sqlgrey as greylisting policy server 
 * postfwd for black-/whitelistig and general postfix target demuxer; it sets
   postfix targets for sasl-authenticated mails, sending to-be-greylisted 
   mails to sqlgrey, does selective greylisting checks and performs
   DNSBL lookups. Finally, it reaches a dummy-target, which is used to simply
   print a syslog-message for further parsing (see below)
 * amavisd-new as virus-scanning middleware
 * clamav for the actually scanning process
 * snmpd for SNMP
 * dnsmasq as lightweight DNS forwarder and caching daemon 
 * monit to ensure service- and daemon availability
 * munin to do some resource graphs
 * MySQL as the common database-backend, used for greylisting-db, stats, etc
 * Nginx is the web-server of choice for serving the web-frontend and
   the munin graphs
 * ntpd
 * syslog-ng as syslog daemon
 * a modified version of cyrus-sasl for proxying SASL requests to MTAs


AS-specific components:
 * rtlog: A real time syslog parsing engine, aiming to provide easy-to-use
   real-time information of the mail-flow (e.g. "Live-Log", Simple Log Search,
   etc)
 * quarantine-ng: an end-user quarantine, which defines quarantine-boxed for
   each user (though, their mailboxes are not stored on the OpenAS itself),
   and offering the possibility for the users to release and/or delete mails
   in their quarantine boxes without the intervention of the administrator.
   The whole quarantine-ng is managed through emails: e.g. if a user wants to
   release a mail from the quarantine-box, he/she clicks on a mailto: link
   inside the daily spam report he/she is automatically receiving every day,
   and a mail containing a special character-code in the mail body is sent to
   the OpenAS itself, where the quarantine-ng daemon reacts accordingly. This
   mail-only approach makes it easy-to-use without additional software 
   installation, and is client independent.
 * saslauthd: the saslauthd sources have been patched in order to support
   proxying SASL authentication requests to SMTP servers, which have been
   configured on the AS web-frontend to support SMTP authentication
 

Basically everything AS-specific is done in Perl, using numerous CPAN modules,
whereas most of them are already available via Ubuntu packages. The core code
is contained in the lib/lib/Underground8 directory.

Appliance/			Main appliance object, the root of the config-model tree
Configuration/		Meta-configuration, according to GUI
Services/			Low-level service handler/controller. Every service has
					a SLAVE.pm, which does the low-level stuff.
QuarantineNG/		quarantine implementation
Exception/			Perl exception definitions
ReportFactors/		Generates system reports
Log/				rtlogd stuff 
Misc/				s/t

Configuration files, GUI pages and some other files are managed through Template
Toolkit (TT2) templates, and reside in lib/etc/cfg-templates (in an installed
environment, under /etc/open-as-cgw/cfg-templates).
