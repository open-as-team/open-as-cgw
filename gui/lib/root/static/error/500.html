				<h2>Are You currently upgrading or restarting?</h2>
				<p>If you've reached this page after you've started the <strong>update process</strong> via System Updates or <strong>rebooted the appliance</strong> for some reason, then everything is perfectly normal.</p>
				<p>After waiting for <strong>10 minutes</strong> this pages <strong>automatically refreshes</strong> and your AS Communication Gateway&trade; returns to its <strong>normal functionality.</strong></p>

			<div id="bottom">
				<h3>You have already refreshed this page and it is still showing?</h3>
				<p>Unfortunatly there is something wrong with your AS Communication Gateway. You now have three possibilities to fix the problem. Please note that you should only try them in the correct order. Note that when you <strong>restart the GUI</strong> your AS will be out of service for only a few seconds but if you <strong>restart the whole appliance</strong> it can be out up to 3 minutes.</p>
